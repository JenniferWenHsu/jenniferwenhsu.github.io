<h3> Mirage and Fata Morgana </h3>
<h5>Summary: </h5>
<p>
Mirage and Fata Morgana are optical effects caused by light bending due to differences in air density. Our goal is to modify the ray tracing scheme from proj3-1 and proj3-2 to take into account this non-linear bending. Hopefully, the final product will be able to model a realistic atmosphere (e.g. dessert after a hot day) and correctly ray trace scenes situated in such conditions.</p>
